# basic-knowledge-base-python

This Python project was developed during the CS50 Artificial Intelligence course. It allows defining knowledge using Boolean operators and extracting solutions.

## Overview

The project enables the creation of a basic knowledge base in Python, where knowledge can be structured and queried using Boolean logic. It supports operations to define knowledge and retrieve solutions based on specified queries.

## Learning Resource

To learn more about how knowledge is managed and queried in this project, refer to the CS50 Artificial Intelligence course lecture on knowledge bases: [CS50 AI Lecture - Knowledge](https://youtu.be/HWQLez87vqM?si=-VGgNdnrRuh-nq4R).
